# Feature Specification: AI Image Editing Canvas Library

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "AI image editing canvas tool for mask creation and layer management"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer integrating AI image editing capabilities into their application needs a canvas component where end-users can:
1. Load an image onto the canvas
2. Create multiple mask layers using various drawing tools (brush, magnetic brush, outline tool)
3. Manage these mask layers (reorder, change colors, delete)
4. Zoom in/out while maintaining image quality
5. Export the image and mask data for AI model processing

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an image is loaded on the canvas, **When** user selects brush tool and draws on the image, **Then** a new mask layer is created with the drawn region highlighted
2. **Given** multiple mask layers exist, **When** user reorders layers in the sidebar, **Then** the visual stacking order updates immediately on the canvas
3. **Given** user has drawn a mask, **When** user selects erase tool and erases part of the mask, **Then** only the erased region is removed from that specific layer
4. **Given** canvas is at 100% zoom, **When** user zooms to 400%, **Then** image remains sharp without pixelation
5. **Given** user has created masks using outline tool, **When** user places multiple dots on canvas, **Then** a closed polygon mask is created connecting all dots
6. **Given** user selects magnetic brush tool, **When** user clicks near object edges, **Then** the tool automatically detects and traces object boundaries

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user attempts to draw outside canvas boundaries?
- How does system handle extremely large images (> 100MB)?
- What happens if magnetic brush fails to detect object edges?
- How does layer reordering work when 20+ layers exist?
- What happens when user zooms beyond maximum practical zoom level?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to load images onto the canvas from local file system
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a brush tool that creates mask regions by freehand drawing
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a magnetic brush tool that detects and traces object boundaries automatically
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide an outline tool that creates polygon masks from user-placed points
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide an erase tool that removes portions of existing masks
- **FR-006**: System MUST create a new layer for each mask drawing action
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to reorder layers (move forward/backward in stack)
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to change the color of individual mask layers
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to delete individual mask layers
- **FR-010**: System MUST support zoom in/out functionality without degrading image quality
- **FR-011**: System MUST display all mask layers in a sidebar with layer management controls
- **FR-012**: System MUST export canvas data including original image and mask layer information
- **FR-013**: System MUST be embeddable as a library component in external applications
- **FR-014**: Canvas MUST maintain aspect ratio of loaded images
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide visual feedback for active tool selection
- **FR-016**: Each mask layer MUST be independently editable without affecting other layers

### Performance Requirements
- **PF-001**: Canvas rendering MUST maintain 60fps during drawing operations (p95 latency < 200ms per constitution)
- **PF-002**: Zoom operations MUST complete within 100ms
- **PF-003**: Layer reordering MUST reflect visually within 50ms
- **PF-004**: System MUST handle images up to 20MB
- **PF-005**: Magnetic brush object detection MUST complete within 2 seconds

### User Experience Requirements
- **UX-001**: Error messages MUST be actionable and user-friendly (e.g., "Image file too large. Please use images under 20MB" instead of generic errors)
- **UX-002**: Tool state changes MUST provide clear visual feedback (cursor changes, active tool highlighting)
- **UX-003**: Canvas operations MUST not block UI interactions (async operations with loading indicators)
- **UX-004**: Layer sidebar MUST display visual thumbnails of each mask for easy identification
- **UX-005**: Undo/redo functionality MUST be available for all drawing actions (brush strokes, layer operations, erase actions, outline creation)

### Key Entities
- **Canvas**: The primary drawing surface that displays the loaded image and all mask layers
- **Mask Layer**: An independent drawable layer containing mask regions with properties (color, opacity, z-index)
- **Drawing Tool**: Different tools (brush, magnetic brush, outline, eraser) with specific behaviors
- **Image**: The source image loaded onto the canvas for editing
- **Export Data**: Structured data containing original image reference and all mask layer information in a format suitable for AI model consumption
